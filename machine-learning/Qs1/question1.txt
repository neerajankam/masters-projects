Download 'regression_data.csv' and 'regression_data.readme.txt' from the files section of the course website and identify the best model for the data from the following set of possible models:

Ordinary least squares
Lasso Regression with a regularization coefficient of either 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, or 2
Kernalized Ridge Regression with a regularization coefficient of 1 and
a linear kernal
polynomial kernels with coefficients gamma = 1, r = 1, and M of either 2, 4, 7
isotoptic gaussian kernel with coefficient sigma of either 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4
