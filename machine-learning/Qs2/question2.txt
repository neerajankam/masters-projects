Download 'classification_data.tsv' and 'classification_data.readme.txt' from the files section of the course website and identify the best model for the data from the following set of possible models:

Kernalized Ridge Regression with a regularization coefficient of 1 and
a linear kernal
polynomial kernels with coefficients gamma = 1, r = 1, and M of either 2, 3
isotoptic gaussian kernel with coefficient sigma of either 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4
Logistic Regression
Hard margin SVM
Soft margin SVM with a coefficient of either 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5
